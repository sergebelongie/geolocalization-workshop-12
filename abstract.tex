Ground Level to Aerial Image Dataset (GLAID) is a challenging image dataset for image based geolocation.  It was created to enable the study of matching ground level images to $45^\circ$ aerial images, which has not been studied by the popular datasets that focus on matching images within the same condition.  The new challenges of cross condition matching include wide disparities in viewpoint and imaging conditions which often lead to feature matching failure.  To assess the strength and weakness of the existed methods, we benchmark top-down holistic image-as-texture based matching and bottom-up local interest point near-duplicate retrieval, providing an overview of the performance for the new challenge.  Finally, by analyzing the failure case for the existed approaches, we help to identify the future research directions for cross condition image geolocation.
